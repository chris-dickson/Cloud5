	var text = 'Drafting 	The Preamble was placed in the Constitution during the last days of the Constitutional ' +
		'Convention by the Committee on Style, which wrote its final draft. It was not proposed or discussed on the ' +
		'floor of the convention beforehand. The initial wording of the preamble did not refer to the people of the ' +
		'United States, rather, it referred to people of the various states, which was the norm. In earlier documents, ' +
		'including the 1778 Treaty of Alliance with France, the Articles of Confederation, and the 1783 Treaty of Paris ' +
		'recognizing American independence, the word "people" was not used, and the phrase the United States was ' +
		'followed immediately by a listing of the states, from north to south.[1] The change was made out of necessity, ' +
		'as the Constitution provided that whenever the popularly elected ratifying conventions of nine states gave ' +
		'their approval, it would go into effect for those nine, irrespective of whether any of the remaining states ' +
		'ratified.[2]  	Meaning and application 	The Preamble serves solely as an introduction, and does not assign ' +
		'powers to the federal government,[3] nor does it provide specific limitations on government action. Due to the ' +
		'Preamble \'s limited nature, no court has ever used it as a decisive factor in case adjudication,[4] except as ' +
		'regards frivolous litigation.[5]  	Judicial relevance 	The courts have shown interest in any clues they can ' +
		'find in the Preamble regarding the Constitution \'s meaning.[6] Courts have developed several techniques for ' +
		'interpreting the meaning of statutes and these are also used to interpret the Constitution.[7] As a result, ' +
		'the courts have said that interpretive techniques that focus on the exact text of a document[8] should be used ' +
		'in interpreting the meaning of the Constitution. Balanced against these techniques are those that focus more ' +
		'attention on broader efforts to discern the meaning of the document from more than just the wording;[9] the ' +
		'Preamble is also useful for these efforts to identify the "spirit" of the Constitution.  	Additionally, when ' +
		'interpreting a legal document, courts are usually interested in understanding the document as its authors did' +
		' and their motivations for creating it;[10] as a result, the courts have cited the Preamble for evidence of ' +
		'the history, intent and meaning of the Constitution as it was understood by the Founders.[11] Although ' +
		'revolutionary in some ways, the Constitution maintained many common law concepts (such as habeas corpus, trial ' +
		'by jury, and sovereign immunity),[12] and courts deem that the Founders \' perceptions of the legal system ' +
		'that the Constitution created (i.e., the interaction between what it changed and what it kept from the British ' +
		'legal system[13]) are uniquely important because of the authority "the People" invested them with to create ' +
		'it.[14] Along with evidence of the understandings of the men who debated and drafted the Constitution at the ' +
		'Constitutional Convention, the courts are also interested in the way that government officials have put into ' +
		'practice the Constitution \'s provisions, particularly early government officials,[15] although the courts ' +
		'reserve to themselves the final authority to determine the Constitution \'s meaning.[16] However, this focus ' +
		'on historical understandings of the Constitution is sometimes in tension with the changed circumstances of ' +
		'modern society from the late 18th century society that drafted the Constitution; courts have ruled that the ' +
		'Constitution must be interpreted in light of these changed circumstances.[17] All of these considerations of ' +
		'the political theory behind the Constitution have prompted the Supreme Court to articulate a variety of ' +
		'special rules of construction and principles for interpreting it.[18] For example, the Court \'s rendering ' +
		'of the purposes behind the Constitution have led it to express a preference for broad interpretations of ' +
		'individual freedoms.[19]  	Examples 	An example of the way courts utilize the Preamble is Ellis v. City of' +
		' Grand Rapids.[20] Substantively, the case was about eminent domain. The City of Grand Rapids wanted to use ' +
		'eminent domain to force landowners to sell property in the city identified as "blighted", and convey the' +
		' property to owners that would develop it in ostensibly beneficial ways: in this case, to St. Mary \'s Hospital,' +
		' a Catholic organization. This area of substantive constitutional law is governed by the Fifth Amendment,' +
		' which is understood to require that property acquired via eminent domain must be put to a "public use". ' +
		'In deciding whether the proposed project constituted a "public use", the court pointed to the Preamble \'s ' +
		'reference to "promot[ing] the general Welfare" as evidence that "[t]he health of the people was in the minds ' +
		'of our forefathers".[21] "[T]he concerted effort for renewal and expansion of hospital and medical care ' +
		'centers, as a part of our nation \'s system of hospitals, is as a public service and use within the highest ' +
		'meaning of such terms. Surely this is in accord with an objective of the United States Constitution:  \'* * *' +
		' promote the general Welfare. \'"[22]  	On the other hand, courts will not interpret the Preamble to give ' +
		'the government powers that are not articulated elsewhere in the Constitution. United States v. Kinnebrew Motor ' +
		'Co.[23] is an example of this. In that case, the defendants were a car manufacturer and dealership indicted ' +
		'for a criminal violation of the National Industrial Recovery Act. The Congress passed the statute in order to' +
		' cope with the Great Depression, and one of its provisions purported to give to the President authority to' +
		' fix "the prices at which new cars may be sold".[24] The dealership, located in Oklahoma City, had sold an ' +
		'automobile to a customer (also from Oklahoma City) for less than the price for new cars fixed pursuant to the ' +
		'Act. Substantively, the case was about whether the transaction in question constituted "interstate commerce" ' +
		'that Congress could regulate pursuant to the Commerce Clause.[25] Although the government argued that the ' +
		'scope of the Commerce Clause included this transaction, it also argued that the Preamble \'s statement that ' +
		'the Constitution was created to "promote the general Welfare" should be understood to permit Congress to ' +
		'regulate transactions such as the one in this case, particularly in the face of an obvious national emergency' +
		' like the Great Depression. The court, however, dismissed this argument as erroneous[26] and insisted that ' +
		'the only relevant issue was whether the transaction that prompted the indictment actually constituted ' +
		'"interstate commerce" under the Supreme Court \'s precedents that interpreted the scope of the Commerce' +
		' Clause.[27]  	Interpretation 	Aspects of national sovereignty 	The Preamble \'s reference to the "United ' +
		'States of America" has been interpreted over the years to explain the nature of the governmental entity that ' +
		'the Constitution created (i.e., the federal government). In contemporary international law, the world consists' +
		' of sovereign states (or "sovereign nations" in modern equivalent). A state is said to be "sovereign," if any' +
		' of its ruling inhabitants are the supreme authority over it; the concept is distinct from mere land-title or ' +
		'"ownership."[28] While each state was originally recognized as sovereign unto itself, the Supreme Court held ' +
		'that the "United States of America" consists of only one sovereign nation with respect to foreign affairs and' +
		' international relations; the individual states may not conduct foreign relations.[29] Although the Constitution' +
		' expressly delegates to the federal government only some of the usual powers of sovereign governments (such as' +
		' the powers to declare war and make treaties), all such powers inherently belong to the federal government as ' +
		'the country \'s representative in the international community.[30]  	Domestically, the federal government \'s' +
		' sovereignty means that it may perform acts such as entering into contracts or accepting bonds, which are typic' +
		'al of governmental entities but not expressly provided for in the Constitution or laws.[31] Similarly, the fede' +
		'ral government, as an attribute of sovereignty, has the power to enforce those powers that are granted to it (e' +
		'.g., the power to "establish Post Offices and Post Roads"[32] includes the power to punish those who interfere ' +
		'with the postal system so established).[33] The Court has recognized the federal government \'s supreme power[3' +
		'4] over those limited matters[35] entrusted to it. Thus, no state may interfere with the federal government \'s' +
		' operations as though its sovereignty is superior to the federal government \'s (discussed more below); for exa' +
		'mple, states may not interfere with the federal government \'s near absolute discretion to sell its own real pr' +
		'operty, even when that real property is located in one or another state.[36] The federal government exercises i' +
		'ts supreme power not as a unitary entity, but instead via the three coordinate branches of the government (legi' +
		'slative, executive, and judicial),[37] each of which has its own prescribed powers and limitations under the Co' +
		'nstitution.[38] In addition, the doctrine of separation of powers functions as a limitation on each branch of t' +
		'he federal government \'s exercise of sovereign power.[39]  	One aspect of the American system of government ' +
		'is that, while the rest of the world now views the United States as one country, domestically American constitu' +
		'tional law recognizes a federation of state governments separate from (and not subdivisions of) the federal ' +
		', each of which is sovereign over its own affairs.[40] Sometimes, the Supreme Court has even analogized the Sta' +
		'tes to being foreign countries to each other to explain the American system of State sovereignty.[41] However, ' +
		'each state \'s sovereignty is limited by the U.S. Constitution, which is the supreme law of both the United Sta' +
		'tes as a nation and each state;[42] in the event of a conflict, a valid federal law controls.[43] As a result, ' +
		'although the federal government is (as discussed above) recognized as sovereign and has supreme power over thos' +
		'e matters within its control, the American constitutional system also recognizes the concept of "State sovereig' +
		'nty," where certain matters are susceptible to government regulation, but only at the State and not the federal' +
		' level.[44] For example, although the federal government prosecutes crimes against the United States (such as t' +
		'reason, or interference with the postal system), the general administration of criminal justice is reserved to ' +
		'the States.[45] Notwithstanding sometimes broad statements by the Supreme Court regarding the "supreme" and "ex' +
		'clusive" powers the State and Federal governments exercise,[46] the Supreme Court and State courts have also re' +
		'cognized that much of their power is held and exercised concurrently.[47]  	People of the United States 	' +
		'The phrase "People of the United States" has sometimes been understood to mean "citizens." This approach reason' +
		's that, if the political community speaking for itself in the Preamble ("We the People") includes only citizens' +
		', by negative implication it specifically excludes non-citizens in some fashion.[48] It has also been construed' +
		' to mean something like "all under the sovereign jurisdiction and authority of the United States."[49] The phra' +
		'se has been construed as affirming that the national government created by the Constitution derives its soverei' +
		'gnty from the people,[50] (whereas "United Colonies" had identified external monarchical sovereignty) as well a' +
		's confirming that the government under the Constitution was intended to govern and protect "the people" directl' +
		'y, as one society, instead of governing only the states as political units.[51] The Court has also understood t' +
		'his language to mean that the sovereignty of the government under the U.S. Constitution is superior to that of ' +
		'the States.[52] Stated in negative terms, the Preamble has been interpreted as meaning that the Constitution wa' +
		's not the act of sovereign and independent states.[53]  	The popular nature of the Constitution 	The Constitu' +
		'tion claims to be an act of "We the People." However, because it represents a general social contract, there ar' +
		'e limits on the ability of individual citizens to pursue legal claims allegedly arising out of the Constitution' +
		'. For example, if a law was enacted which violated the Constitution, not just anybody could challenge the statu' +
		'te \'s constitutionality in court; instead, only an individual who was negatively affected by the unconstitutio' +
		'nal statute could bring such a challenge.[54] For example, a person claiming certain benefits that are created ' +
		'by a statute cannot then challenge, on constitutional grounds, the administrative mechanism that awards them.[5' +
		'5] These same principles apply to corporate entities,[56] and can implicate the doctrine of exhaustion of remed' +
		'ies.[57]  	In this same vein, courts will not answer hypothetical questions about the constitutionality of a st' +
		'atute.[58] The judiciary does not have the authority to invalidate unconstitutional laws solely because they ' +
		' unconstitutional, but may declare a law unconstitutional if its operation would injure a person \'s interests.' +
		'[59] For example, creditors who lose some measure of what they are owed when a bankrupt’s debts are discharged ' +
		'cannot claim injury, because Congress’ power to enact bankruptcy laws is also in the Constitution and inherent ' +
		'in it is the ability to declare certain debts valueless.[60] Similarly, while a person may not generally challe' +
		'nge as unconstitutional a law that they are not accused of violating,[61] once charged, a person may challenge ' +
		'the law \'s validity, even if the challenge is unrelated to the circumstances of the crime.[62]  	Where the Co' +
		'nstitution is legally effective 	The Preamble has been used to confirm that the Constitution was made for, an' +
		'd is binding only in, the United States of America.[63] For example, in Casement v. Squier,[64] a serviceman in' +
		' China during World War II was convicted of murder in the United States Court for China. After being sent to pr' +
		'ison in the State of Washington, he filed a writ of habeas corpus with the local federal court, claiming he had' +
		' been unconstitutionally put on trial without a jury.[65] The court held that, since his trial was conducted ' +
		' an American court and was, by American standards, basically fair, he was not entitled to the specific constitu' +
		'tional right of trial by jury while overseas.[66]  		Since the Preamble declares the Constitution to have' +
		' been created by the "People of the United States", "there may be places within the jurisdiction of the United ' +
		'States that are no part of the Union."[67] The following examples help demonstrate the meaning of this distinct' +
		'ion:[68]  	Geofroy v. Riggs, 133 U.S. 258 (1890): the Supreme Court held that a certain treaty between the Unit' +
		'ed States and France which was applicable in "the States of the Union" was also applicable in Washington, D.C.,' +
		' even though it is not a state or a part of a state. 		De Lima v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 1 (1901): the Supreme C' +
		'ourt ruled that a customs collector could not, under a statute providing for taxes on imported goods, collect t' +
		'axes on goods coming from Puerto Rico after it had been ceded to the United States from Spain, reasoning that a' +
		'lthough it was not a State, it was under the jurisdiction of U.S. sovereignty, and thus the goods were not bein' +
		'g imported from a foreign country. However, in Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 244 (1901), the Court held that the ' +
		'Congress could constitutionally enact a statute taxing goods sent from Puerto Rico to ports in the United State' +
		's differently from other commerce, in spite of the constitutional requirement that "all Duties, Imposts and Exc' +
		'ises shall be uniform throughout the United States,"[69] on the theory that although Puerto Rico could not be t' +
		'reated as a foreign country, it did not count as part of the "United States" and thus was not guaranteed "unifo' +
		'rm" tax treatment by that clause of the Constitution. This was not the only constitutional clause held not to a' +
		'pply in Puerto Rico: later, a lower court went on to hold that goods brought from Puerto Rico into New York bef' +
		'ore the enactment of the tax statute held constitutional in Downes, could retroactively have the taxes applied ' +
		'to them notwithstanding the Constitution \'s ban on ex post facto laws, even if at the time they were brought i' +
		'nto the United States no tax could be applied to the goods because Puerto Rico was not a foreign country.[70] 	' +
		'Ochoa v. Hernandez y Morales, 230 U.S. 139 (1913): the Fifth Amendment \'s requirement that "no person shall . ' +
		'. . be deprived of . . . property, without due process of law" was held, by the Supreme Court, to apply in Puer' +
		'to Rico, even though it was not a State and thus not "part" of the United States. 	To form a more perfect Union' +
		' 	The phrase "to form a more perfect Union" has been construed as referring to the shift to the Constitution f' +
		'rom the Articles of Confederation.[71] In this transition, the "Union" was made "more perfect" by the creation ' +
		'of a federal government with enough power to act directly upon citizens, rather than a government with narrowly' +
		' limited power that could act on citizens (e.g., by imposing taxes) only indirectly through the states.[72] Alt' +
		'hough the Preamble speaks of perfecting the "Union," and the country is called the "United States of America," ' +
		'the Supreme Court has interpreted the institution created as a government over the people, not an agreement bet' +
		'ween the States.[73] The phrase has also been interpreted to confirm that state nullification of any federal la' +
		'w,[74] dissolution of the Union,[75] or secession from it,[76] are not contemplated by the Constitution.';
